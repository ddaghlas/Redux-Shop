# Shop-Shop Redux Store Using STATE

## Description

- Tasked with refactoring the Shop-Shop e-commerce platform, this model uses Redux, as opposed to React's Context API. The application is deployed to Heroku as well, the link provided below.
- Since the open source JavaScript library Redux remains the industry standard for managing complex state in a large-scale React application, this refactored model of the Shop-Shop application is a refactored example.
